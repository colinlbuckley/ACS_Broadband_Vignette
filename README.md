# ACS Broadband Vignette  

## Dependencies:  
-   R version: 4.1.0
-   OS: MacOS 12.6.2
-   Architecture: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit)
-   Key Packages: `censusapi`, `ggplot2`, `sf`, `tidycensus`, `urbnmapr`.
    - Getting data: `censusapi`, `tidycensus`.
    - Cleaning data: `dplyr`, `tidyr`.
    - Mapping/Graphics: `ggplot2`, `sf`, `urbnmapr`.
    
## Project Objectives:
-   Leverage ACS data to create a preliminary proof-of-concept vignette visualizing county-level spatial trends in U.S. broadband access.
-   Get a feel for ACS data structures, Census Bureau APIs, and relevant mapping packages in R.
-   Construct a robust data visualization outline that will facilitate a forthcoming quantitative analysis of broadband access against socioeconomic markers.

## Learning Objectives:  
-   Explore spatial relationships between broadband access and socioeconomic factors.
-   Gain experience with open-source packages that interface with the Census Bureau API including `tidycensus` and `censusapi`. More information about these packages available [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/statistical-software.html).
-   Build intuition re. working with geospatial data in the Tidyverse ecosystem.
